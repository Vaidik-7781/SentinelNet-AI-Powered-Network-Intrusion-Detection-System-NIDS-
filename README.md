# SentinelNet-AI-Powered-Network-Intrusion-Detection-System-NIDS-
📘 Project Overview

SentinelNet is an AI-powered Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) designed to identify malicious network traffic and cyber-attacks in real time.
By leveraging machine learning and anomaly detection techniques, the system analyzes network traffic, extracts features, and classifies behavior as normal or suspicious.
It aims to enhance cybersecurity by providing automated and intelligent threat detection capabilities.

🎯 Project Objectives

1. Understand network traffic and common cyberattack patterns.
2. Apply machine learning algorithms to detect intrusions.
3. Build and evaluate classification models (e.g., Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM).
4. Perform feature engineering and anomaly detection.
5. Generate alerts and logs for detected threats.
6. Document methodology, results, and findings for presentation.

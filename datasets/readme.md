## 📂 Datasets Information

A Google Drive folder named **“Datasets Sentinel-AI”** has been shared, containing **copies of all original datasets** used throughout the project.  
These include the cleaned, encoded, and feature-selected CSV files from all milestones.

The shared folder follows the **same directory structure and file paths** as used in Colab    
so that all notebooks can run smoothly **without needing any path changes**.

This ensures that the original datasets remain safe and unmodified,  
while allowing easy access and reproducibility of results in Google Colab.
